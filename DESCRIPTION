Description: Creates an object that stores a matrix ensemble, matrices
  that share the same common properties, where rows and columns can be
  annotated. Matrices must have the same dimension and dimnames. Operators to
  manipulate these objects are provided as well as mechanisms to apply
  functions to these objects.
